# Groovy Minesweeper

A version of the classic game Minesweeper implemented in Groovy using 
JavaFX w/ FXML. Built out of enjoyment and familiarity with the game and a
desire to test the capability of JavaFX at rendering large amounts of content.

# Usage

Run from a console with the Gradle Wrapper by using the command `gradlew run`.

A runnable JAR will be added in the future.
